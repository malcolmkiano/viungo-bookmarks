# Bookmarks App
See the app [live](https://thinkful-ei-macaw.github.io/malcolmkiano-bookmarks-app/)!

## User stories:
As a user:
- I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
  - title
  - url link
  - description
  - rating (1-5)
- I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
- All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating
- I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
- Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link
- I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list
- I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
- I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
- I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
